# âœ… AUTO-ABSENCE SYSTEM - QUICK SUMMARY

## What We Did:

### 1. **Modified Attendance Model** âœ…
- Made clockIn/clockOut optional (can be null)
- Added `autoMarked` field to track system-generated records
- Added `notes` field for tracking changes
- Default status is now "Absent"

### 2. **Created Scheduled Jobs** âœ…
- **File**: `Backend/jobs/attendanceJobs.js`
- **Job 1**: Runs at **12:20 AM PKT** - Marks all employees absent (early check)
- **Job 2**: Runs at **6:00 PM PKT** - Marks all employees absent (shift start)
- **Job 3**: Runs at **5:30 AM PKT** - Logs final attendance summary

### 3. **Updated Clock-In Logic** âœ…
- Now updates existing "Absent" record instead of creating new one
- Changes status from "Absent" â†’ "Present" when employee clocks in
- Maintains single record per employee per day

### 4. **Added Admin Trigger** âœ…
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/attendance/admin/mark-absences`
- For manual testing or emergency use
- Admin authentication required

### 5. **Initialized Scheduler** âœ…
- Added to `server.js`
- Starts automatically when server runs
- Timezone: Asia/Karachi (Pakistan Standard Time)

## How It Works (Simple Explanation):

```
12:20 AM â†’ System creates "Absent" records for EVERYONE (early check)
          â†“
6:00 PM â†’ System creates "Absent" records for anyone still missing (shift start)
          â†“
6:00 PM - 5:30 AM â†’ Employees clock in, "Absent" changes to "Present"
          â†“
5:30 AM â†’ System logs final report
          â†“
Result â†’ Complete attendance data for all employees!
```

## To Test:

### Option 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended)
```bash
POST https://nextelemployees-1.onrender.com/api/attendance/admin/mark-absences
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

### Option 2: Wait for 6:00 PM PKT
- Server will automatically run the job
- Check admin dashboard - everyone should be marked absent
- Have employee clock in - their status should change to present

---

## Files Modified:
1. âœ… `Backend/models/Attendance.js` - Updated schema
2. âœ… `Backend/jobs/attendanceJobs.js` - NEW file with scheduler
3. âœ… `Backend/controllers/attendance.controller.js` - Updated clock-in logic + trigger endpoint
4. âœ… `Backend/routes/attendance.routes.js` - Added manual trigger route
5. âœ… `Backend/server.js` - Initialize scheduler on startup

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to Render**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add auto-absence marking system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test Manual Trigger**:
   - Use Postman or curl to trigger absence marking
   - Check admin dashboard

3. **Wait for 6:00 PM**:
   - System will run automatically
   - Monitor server logs

4. **Test Clock-In**:
   - Have employee clock in
   - Verify status changes from Absent to Present

---

## Expected Behavior:

| Time | What Happens | Admin Dashboard Shows |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| Before 6 PM | Old/no records | Previous day or empty |
| 6:00 PM | Auto-mark absent | All employees = Absent |
| Employee clocks in | Update to Present | Employee = Present, Others = Absent |
| 5:30 AM | Finalize attendance | Final status locked |

---

## Benefits:

âœ… **Real-time visibility** - See who's absent immediately
âœ… **Complete records** - Every employee gets a record every day
âœ… **No manual work** - Fully automated
âœ… **Accurate reports** - Perfect for payroll and HR
âœ… **Audit trail** - Track auto vs manual records

## ðŸŽ‰ System is Ready!

The auto-absence marking system is now fully implemented and ready to use. It will start working as soon as you deploy to Render and the server starts.
